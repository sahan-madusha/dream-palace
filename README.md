# React Property Search Application

## Overview

This project is a client-side web application that allows users to search for properties based on various criteria. Whether you're looking for a new home or just exploring real estate options, this application provides a user-friendly interface to filter and view property listings. Users can search for properties using the following filters:

- **Property Type**: Choose from House, Flat, or Any.
- **Price Range**: Set a minimum and maximum price for the property.
- **Bedrooms**: Filter properties based on the number of bedrooms.
- **Date Added**: Search properties based on their listing date (after a specific date or between two dates).

The app is built with **React.js**, handles state management for the search and favorites functionality, and stores the user's favorite properties in **local storage** for easy access.
